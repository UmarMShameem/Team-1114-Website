</ul><h5><p>Social Media Algorithms and the Importance Behind Them<p></h5>

<p>As the world has advanced into the digital age, social media has taken the world by storm. It allows people around the world to engage in conversation and 
post media such as videos and pictures from anywhere with internet access. Since platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and Reddit have been made 
available to the public, they have grown tremendously large in terms of users. As of January 2022, the most popular social media network worldwide according 
to Statista was Facebook with 2.9 billion monthly active users. (Most Popular Social Media Networks As Of January 2022, 2022) One of the contributing factors 
to this popularity is the implementation of algorithms. The most popular social media platforms are designed to collect data from their users in order to 
determine what types of content they are interested in and what they are not. This data is then used to personalise each user’s feed according to their 
interests, therefore increasing the amount of time they spend on the website or app.</p>
 <p>How social media algorithms function and affect users has changed throughout the years, and also vary across platforms. For example, Facebook’s news feed 
 started off in 2006 as a basic feature that listed updates from the user’s friends. Now, the scope of content shown to users has widened, as has the data 
 collected from them, including comments, search history, “like” history, and the amount of time spent viewing various types of content. (Oremus, Alcantara, 
 Merrill, & Galocha, 2021) In the case of Facebook, community engagement is key to determining which posts have a wide reach, prioritising popularity, content 
 type, and recency. Pinterest, on the other hand, has more of an interest-themed approach to its algorithm, prioritising content based on the quality of the 
 pin and the pinner, as well as relevance of the topic to the user. Twitter, like Facebook, also bases its algorithm on engagement and recency, but also media 
 types like GIFs and photos, while Instagram’s algorithm is driven by interest, relationship between users, time posted, and user session time. (O'Brien, 2022) 
 All this data collected means the content shown to users can have a strong impact on not only how much time they spend using the website/app, but also 
 possibly their views, the way they interact with others, and even sometimes their mental health. This can also determine what types of content go viral 
 and which users fail to grow their audience.</p>
 <p>It is important to note that while social media algorithms come with their benefits, they also have some downsides, particularly in the ways that they 
 affect people. Especially in the case of platforms like Pinterest, algorithms can be useful for filtering out irrelevant content and only show what the user 
 is interested in by taking into account their past interactions on certain content. This can come with benefits such as encouraging healthy, productive 
 interaction among communities, keeping them entertained in their spare time, and even improving their mood if what they are shown is funny or wholesome. 
 In some cases, however, algorithms can harm users, especially if the company responsible for the platform has a flawed approach to its algorithm design. 
 Some people are shown harmful content such as misinformation and distressing videos, photos, or written posts, which often have a negative impact on the 
 mental health of individuals and how they communicate with each other. Another concern raised over social media algorithms is the amount of data collected 
 from users by companies and whether they only use it for the algorithms or if they are being illegally accessed. One major reason for these concerns is the 
 Facebook data breach that occurred in 2021, which resulted in the personal data of over 500 million Facebook users being leaked and posted on a hacking forum.
