<h1>Technology Opportunities</h1>


</ul><h4><p>Opportunities of social media algorithms<p></h4>

<p>The main idea behind algorithms on social media is to show users content that is relevant to their interests and filter out what they may not be interested 
in, therefore it can be quite useful in some ways. Firstly, it greatly improves user experience. Without any type of algorithm to sort content by relevance to 
the user, they would be seeing all kinds of posts they would not be interested in. Because algorithms take the user’s personal data and use it to find content 
that matches their interests, their “home feed” would, for the most part, show all sorts of images, videos, and written posts that would catch their eye. 
Pinterest is a strong example of this, because, if for example you search for fan art based on your favourite book series, that content would quickly start 
filling up your “browse” page, like any other content that was previously searched for. This is also good for ad relevance. Facebook, for example, will use 
data such as search history and amount of time spent viewing certain content to look for ads that match the user’s interests. Users are therefore more likely 
to come across items that they like on places such as the Facebook marketplace. This also helps make more money for the advertiser and the company behind the 
platform. Without an algorithm to filter out irrelevant content, there would not be much use to features like Facebook’s home feed, and usage of the platform 
would likely be lower than it is now. On top of things such as a user’s “likes”, their search history, or their time spent viewing which types of content, 
some algorithms will prioritise posts from the user’s friends and family, making it easier to keep up with each other, especially in the case that they live 
far away from each other and knowing what they are up to would otherwise be difficult. (Settlage, 2021)
</p>
<p>By learning how each platform’s algorithm works, content creators can use it to their advantage and grow their audience. Especially on platforms such as 
Facebook, the algorithm prioritises posts that generate lots of engagement (likes, comments, and shares). Creating a “call-to-action” post, such as a 
question, poll, or any other type of post that encourages people to post comments is a good way for content creators to reach a large number of users. 
“Tagging” is also another feature that can help creators reach more people. For example, when user A tags user B in a post, the algorithm helps that post 
reach user B’s audience and grow user A’s audience even further. Additionally, most platforms have a categorising-type feature such as tags or flairs. When 
making a post on Facebook, putting on relevant hashtags makes that post more searchable, so by using a hashtag such as #nike, that post is more likely to 
appear to users interested in the Nike tag. Lastly, timing is an important factor to consider when trying to generate more engagement on a post, and this will
 vary between audience types and platforms. Knowing when your audience is most likely to be active will serve as a big advantage. For example, if a person is
 focusing on an audience based in a certain country, it is easy to guess when people are going to be awake and not busy. If a person’s audience consists of 
 followers globally, timing is a bit trickier, and those content creators will have to consider during which hours users are most active on a specific 
 platform. (Barnhart, 2021)
